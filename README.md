Make your presentation look simple but cool with [gruvbox's](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) beautiful and pleasant colors.

I basically took beamer's Madrid theme and riced it with gruvbox colors. I mostly use colors from gruvbox dark theme. I did not use all the colors because I dont need them. But feel free to add more colors.

If you make it nicer, it would be nice to let me know.
